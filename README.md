# Aquarium-Data-Generation
A data generation model for simulation of reef aquarium parameters

Data Generation AI model for my Final Year Project.

Usage of the data generated is for the purpose of training a machine learning model such that it is able to response to changes in reef tank parameter changes and perform automated adjustments.
